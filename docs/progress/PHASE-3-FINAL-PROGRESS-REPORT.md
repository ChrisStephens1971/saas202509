- Complete HTML email templates for all Phase 3 events
- Plain text fallback auto-generated from HTML
- Django email backend integration
- Tenant branding support

**Email Notifications Implemented:**

**Violations:**
- Violation created → Owner notification

- Fine posted → Owner notification with invoice details

**ARC Requests:**
- Request submitted → Committee notification
- Status changed → Owner notification (approved/denied/conditional)

**Work Orders:**
- Work order assigned → Vendor notification
- Work order completed → Property manager notification

**Budgets:**
- Budget variance alert → Treasurer/Board notification

**Key Features:**
- HTML email templates with proper formatting

- Error handling and logging

**Example Email Template:**
```html
<h2>Violation Escalation Notice</h2>
<p>Dear {owner.first_name} {owner.last_name},</p>
<p>The violation at Unit {unit.unit_number} has been escalated.</p>
<h3>Violation Details:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Type:</strong> {violation_type.name}</li>
  <li><strong>Escalation Step:</strong> {escalation.step_number}</li>
  <li><strong>Fine Amount:</strong> ${escalation.fine_amount}</li>
</ul>
```

### 2. File Upload Service (330+ lines)

**File:** `backend/accounting/services/file_upload_service.py`

**Implementation:**
- S3 and local storage support (Django storage backend abstraction)
- File validation (size limits, extension whitelist)
- Unique filename generation (timestamp + UUID)
- Category-specific upload methods
- File management (upload, delete, get info)

**Supported File Types:**
- **Images:** .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .heic (max 10MB)
- **Documents:** .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx (max 25MB)

**Upload Methods:**
```python
# Violation photos
FileUploadService.upload_violation_photo(file, violation_id)
# Returns: (success, file_url, file_size)

# ARC documents (plans, specs, photos, contracts, other)
FileUploadService.upload_arc_document(file, arc_request_id, document_type)

# Work order attachments
FileUploadService.upload_work_order_attachment(file, work_order_id)
```

**Storage Structure:**
```
violations/{violation_id}/photos/
arc-requests/{arc_request_id}/{document_type}/
work-orders/{work_order_id}/attachments/
```

**Key Features:**
