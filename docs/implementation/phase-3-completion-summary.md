## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Planning First:** Detailed sprint plans made implementation straightforward
2. **Consistent Patterns:** Following existing API patterns sped up development
3. **Test-Driven Mindset:** Writing tests alongside services caught issues early
4. **Clear Separation:** Business logic in services, not in views/serializers

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Admin Field Names:** Fixed 4 admin classes with incorrect field references
2. **URL Encoding:** Replaced emoji characters for Windows compatibility
3. **Database Timeouts:** Created URL-only tests when DB wasn't needed

### Best Practices Applied
1. **Multi-tenant from the start:** All models include tenant FK
2. **Audit trail built-in:** created_at, updated_at, created_by on all models
3. **Read-only serializers:** Display fields (status_display, owner_name) for better UX
4. **List vs Detail serializers:** Performance optimization for table views
