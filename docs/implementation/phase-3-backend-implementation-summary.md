## Key Technical Features

### 1. Multi-Tenant Isolation
- All models include `tenant` FK
- Tenant-specific unique constraints
- Schema-per-tenant ready

### 2. Accounting Integration
- **Violations:** Fines link to Invoice and JournalEntry
- **Work Orders:** Invoices link to JournalEntry for GL coding
- **Budget:** Pulls actuals from GL transactions

### 3. Audit Trail
- All models track `created_at`/`updated_at`
- Immutable financial records (event sourcing)
- User tracking on all actions (`created_by`, `approved_by`, etc.)

### 4. Workflow States
- **Violations:** Open → Escalated → Fined → Closed
- **ARC Requests:** Draft → Submitted → Review → Approved → Completed
- **Work Orders:** Draft → Open → Assigned → In Progress → Completed → Closed

### 5. File Storage
- Photo/document URLs (S3-ready)
- File size tracking
- Upload timestamps and user tracking

## What Remains To Be Done

### 1. API Layer (High Priority)

**Serializers:**
- Create DRF serializers for all 16 new models
- Add nested serializers for related objects
- Implement validation logic

**API Endpoints:**
- RESTful CRUD endpoints for all models
- Custom actions (escalate, approve, assign, etc.)
- Filtering, sorting, pagination
- File upload handling
- Estimated: 1,500-2,000 lines of code

**Files to Create/Update:**
- `backend/accounting/serializers.py` (add ~800 lines)
- `backend/accounting/api_views.py` (add ~1,200 lines)
- `backend/accounting/urls.py` (add ~50 lines)

### 2. Frontend Pages (High Priority)

**React/TypeScript Pages:**
- 15+ new pages across all sprints
- Forms, tables, detail views
- File upload components
- Status badges and workflows
- Estimated: 3,000-4,000 lines of code

**Sprint 15: Violation Tracking (3 pages)**
- ViolationsListPage
- CreateViolationPage
- ViolationDetailPage

**Sprint 16: ARC Workflow (3 pages)**
- ARCRequestsListPage
- SubmitARCRequestPage (owner portal)
- ARCRequestDetailPage
