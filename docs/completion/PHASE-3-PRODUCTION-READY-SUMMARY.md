## Security Considerations

### File Uploads

- ✅ File size limits enforced (10MB images, 25MB documents)
- ✅ File extension whitelist
- ✅ Unique filename generation (prevents overwriting)
- ✅ Separate folders by entity type
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Add virus scanning for uploaded files
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Implement signed URLs for S3 access

### Email Notifications

- ✅ HTML escaping for user-provided content
- ✅ Rate limiting on notification endpoints
- ⚠️ **TODO:** SPF/DKIM configuration for email domain
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Unsubscribe functionality

### API Security

- ✅ Authentication required for all endpoints
- ✅ Tenant isolation (all queries filtered by tenant)
- ✅ Permission checks for sensitive actions
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Rate limiting on API endpoints
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Input sanitization for file uploads

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database

- ✅ Indexes on foreign keys
- ✅ Indexes on status fields for filtering
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Add indexes for date range queries
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Optimize budget variance query (can be slow with large datasets)

### File Storage

- ✅ Lazy loading of file metadata
- ✅ Thumbnail generation for images
- ⚠️ **TODO:** CDN for file delivery
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Image resizing on upload

### Frontend

- ✅ TanStack Query caching for API responses
- ✅ Optimistic updates for mutations
- ✅ Lazy loading of modal components
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Virtual scrolling for large lists
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Code splitting by route

---

## Known Limitations

1. **File Upload Progress:** No progress indicator for large file uploads
