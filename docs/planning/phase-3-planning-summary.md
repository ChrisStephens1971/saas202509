# Phase 3 Planning Summary - Operational Features

**Planning Completed:** 2025-10-29
**Phase Timeline:** Q4 2026 - Q1 2027 (estimated)
**Total Sprints:** 5 sprints (Sprints 14-18)
**Estimated Effort:** 10-12 weeks total

---

## Overview

Phase 3 focuses on **Operational Features** that enable HOAs to manage day-to-day operations beyond accounting. These features address Pain Point #4 (Budget Planning) and Pain Point #5 (Operations & Compliance) from the requirements document.

### Strategic Goals

1. **Complete the operational workflow:** Beyond accounting, HOAs need tools to manage violations, architectural requests, work orders, and budgets
2. **Financial accountability:** Link all operational activities to the general ledger for complete financial tracking
3. **Compliance protection:** Provide audit trails and documentation for legal protection
4. **Competitive positioning:** Match feature parity with full-service HOA platforms (AppFolio, Buildium)

## Technical Architecture

### Common Patterns Across All Sprints

**1. Multi-Tenant Isolation**
- All models include tenant FK
- Row-level security enforced
- Data isolation per HOA

**2. Accounting Integration**
- Violations: Fines → Invoice → Journal Entry (AR + Revenue)
- Work Orders: Vendor invoice → Journal Entry (Expense + AP)
- Budget: Actuals pulled from GL transactions

**3. Document Storage**
- Local filesystem for MVP
- S3 migration path for production
- Retention: Permanent (legal/audit requirements)

**4. Timeline/Workflow Tracking**
- Every action logged with timestamp and user
- Immutable audit trail
- Status transitions tracked

**5. Email Notifications**
- Status change triggers (via existing EmailService)
- Owner, board, and vendor notifications
- Certified notice tracking (for violations)

---

## Dependencies

### Cross-Sprint Dependencies

**Sprint 14 (Reserve Planning) Dependencies:**
- Requires Fund model (Sprint 1-5)
- Links to reserve fund bank balances

**Sprint 15 (Violations) Dependencies:**
- Requires Invoice and JournalEntry models (Sprint 3-4)
- Uses EmailService (Sprint 6)

**Sprint 16 (ARC) Dependencies:**
- Requires Owner/Unit models (Sprint 2-3)
- Uses document storage (similar to Sprint 15)

**Sprint 17 (Work Orders) Dependencies:**
- Requires JournalEntry and GLAccount models (Sprint 4)
- Links to Fund model
- Can trigger from Violations (Sprint 15) or ARC (Sprint 16)

**Sprint 18 (Budget) Dependencies:**
- Requires complete GL implementation (Sprint 4-5)
- Pulls actual spending from journal entries
- Uses Fund structure

### External Dependencies

**Third-Party Services:**
- S3 (or equivalent) for document storage
- Email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, or SMTP)
- GPS/camera browser APIs (for violation photos)

**No New Infrastructure:**
- All features use existing PostgreSQL database
- No new external APIs required
- Leverage existing authentication/authorization

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks

| GL integration complexity (budget actuals) | High | Medium | Thorough testing, spreadsheet validation |
| User adoption (owners submitting requests) | High | High | Simple UX, mobile-friendly forms |
| State-specific compliance (violation notices) | Medium | Medium | Research 3 states (CA, FL, TX), add configurability |

### Medium Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|-----------|

## Implementation Timeline

### Recommended Sequence

**Option 1: Sequential (Lower Risk)**
- Sprint 14 → Sprint 15 → Sprint 16 → Sprint 17 → Sprint 18
- 10 weeks total (2 weeks per sprint)
- Each sprint fully completed before starting next
- Lower risk, easier to manage

**Option 2: Parallel Backend + Sequential Frontend (Faster)**
- Weeks 1-4: Build all backend models and APIs (Sprints 14-18)
- Weeks 5-10: Build frontend pages sequentially
- 10 weeks total, but backend complete earlier
- Higher risk, requires careful planning

**Option 3: MVP Fast-Track (Minimal Viable Features)**
- Sprint 15 (Violations) - 1.5 weeks (high priority stories only)
- Sprint 17 (Work Orders) - 1.5 weeks (high priority stories only)
- Sprint 18 (Budget) - 2 weeks (essential variance reporting)
- Skip Sprint 14 (Reserve Planning) and Sprint 16 (ARC) for now
- 5 weeks total for core operational features
- Add Sprints 14 and 16 later based on demand

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (Sequential) for solo founder, Option 2 (Parallel) if team grows

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

**Backend:**
- Model validation (all fields, constraints)
- Business logic (fine calculation, variance calculation)
- GL integration (correct journal entries created)

**Frontend:**

### Integration Testing

**Critical Paths:**
1. Violation → Fine → Invoice → Journal Entry → Owner Ledger

### End-to-End Testing

**User Scenarios:**
- Inspector creates violation, escalates, fine posted correctly
