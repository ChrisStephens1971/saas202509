## 📝 Testing Best Practices Established

### Test Structure
```python
@pytest.fixture
def tenant(db):
    """Create test tenant"""
    return Tenant.objects.create(...)

@pytest.mark.django_db
class TestFeatureName:
    """Test specific feature"""

    def test_specific_behavior(self, tenant):
        """Test docstring"""
        # Arrange
        # Act
        # Assert
```

### Accounting Test Principles
1. ✅ Always test double-entry (debits = credits)
2. ✅ Use Decimal for all money calculations
3. ✅ Test precision (exactly 2 decimal places)
4. ✅ Test edge cases (zero, negative, large amounts)
5. ✅ Test immutability (no UPDATE/DELETE of financial records)
6. ✅ Test balance calculations
7. ✅ Test trial balance integrity

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Always check existing implementations first** - The PDF generation and email features were already fully implemented, saving 1-2 weeks of development time.

2. **Test coverage is critical for financial systems** - With zero tolerance for errors, comprehensive tests are not optional.

3. **Decimal vs Float matters** - Using Decimal prevents catastrophic rounding errors in financial calculations.

4. **Document as you build** - The deployment report and this completion summary provide valuable project history.

5. **QA project integration** - Having a dedicated QA project (saas202510) with automated test queueing is excellent practice.
