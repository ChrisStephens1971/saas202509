# OKRs - Q4 2025 / Q1 2026 (Phase 1: Foundation)

**Period:** 2025-10-28 - 2026-03-31 (20 weeks)
**Owner:** Chris Stephens (Solo Founder)
**Status:** Planning
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-27

---

## Company Vision & Strategy

**Vision:** Build the most accurate and trusted fund accounting system for Homeowners Associations that solves the pain points legacy systems ignore: proper fund accounting, automated bank reconciliation, and systematic collections workflow.

**This Period's Focus:** Build bulletproof accounting foundation with zero tolerance for financial errors. Prove we can maintain audit-grade accuracy with multi-fund general ledger and double-entry bookkeeping.

**Philosophy for MVP:** Simple OKRs for solo founder. Focus on learning accounting domain, building core correctly, and validating with friendly pilot customers.

---

## Objective 1: Prove Accounting Foundation Works

**Why this matters:** Everything depends on getting the accounting foundation right. Financial data has zero tolerance for errors. If we can't post balanced journal entries and generate accurate trial balances, nothing else matters.

### Key Result 1.1: Successfully post 1,000+ journal entries with 100% accuracy

- **Target:** 1,000 journal entries posted across 3-5 pilot HOAs with zero imbalanced entries
- **Current:** 0 journal entries posted
- **Progress:** 0% ðŸŸ¡
- **Owner:** Chris Stephens
- **Confidence:** Medium (learning curve on accounting domain)

**What this means:**
- All journal entries must balance (debits = credits)
- Support all fund types (operating, reserve, special assessment)
- Immutable records (event sourcing - never UPDATE/DELETE)
- Cryptographic hash chain for tamper detection

**Progress Updates:**
- 2025-10-27: OKRs created, Sprint 1 planned

---

### Key Result 1.2: Generate accurate financial statements for 3 pilot HOAs

- **Target:** 3 HOAs with complete financial statements (balance sheet by fund, income statement, trial balance)
- **Current:** 0 HOAs onboarded
- **Progress:** 0% ðŸŸ¡
- **Owner:** Chris Stephens
- **Confidence:** Medium (depends on finding friendly pilot customers)

**What this means:**
- Balance sheet per fund (operating, reserve, special assessment)
- Income statement (revenue and expenses)
- Trial balance (debits = credits proof)
- Statements pass CPA review (correctness validation)

**Progress Updates:**
- 2025-10-27: Need to identify 3-5 friendly HOA boards for pilot program

---

### Key Result 1.3: Maintain 100% trial balance accuracy (zero unbalanced ledgers)

- **Target:** 100% of trial balances generated must balance (total debits = total credits)
- **Current:** N/A (no system yet)
- **Progress:** 0% ðŸŸ¡
- **Owner:** Chris Stephens
- **Confidence:** High (this is non-negotiable, system validation will enforce)

**What this means:**
- Every query of trial balance must show: SUM(debits) = SUM(credits)
- If trial balance doesn't balance, there's a bug â†’ fix immediately
- Automated tests to verify balancing on every journal entry post
- Manual spot-checks weekly with pilot HOAs

**Progress Updates:**
- 2025-10-27: Will build automated validation into journal entry service

---

## Objective 2: Master HOA Accounting Domain

**Why this matters:** I'm building financial software for a specialized domain (fund accounting for HOAs) that I don't fully understand yet. Can't build correct software without understanding the domain deeply. Learning curve is the primary risk.

### Key Result 2.1: Complete accounting education and document learnings

- **Target:** Read 2 books + document 20 key accounting concepts with HOA-specific examples
- **Current:** 0 books read, basic double-entry knowledge
- **Progress:** 0% ðŸŸ¡
- **Owner:** Chris Stephens
- **Confidence:** High (learning is controllable)

**Books to Read:**
1. "Accounting Made Simple" by Mike Piper (focus: double-entry bookkeeping)
2. "Fund Accounting" by Leon E. Hay (focus: fund accounting principles)

**20 Key Concepts to Document:**
1. Double-entry bookkeeping
2. Debits vs credits by account type
3. Normal balances (assets/liabilities/equity/revenue/expense)
4. Trial balance
5. Fund accounting (operating vs reserve vs special assessment)
6. Chart of accounts structure
7. Journal entries vs general ledger
8. Accounting periods and period close
9. Accrual vs cash basis accounting
10. Revenue recognition (when to recognize dues)
11. AR aging and collections
12. Late fee calculations
13. Interest accrual (compound monthly)
14. Prepaid assessments (deferred revenue)
15. Reserve contributions (inter-fund transfers)
16. Special assessments (one-time vs installment)
17. Bank reconciliation fundamentals
18. Immutable audit trails (event sourcing)
19. Point-in-time reconstruction
20. GAAP compliance for HOA financials

**Progress Updates:**
- 2025-10-27: Ordered "Accounting Made Simple" - arriving this week

---

### Key Result 2.2: Consult with 2 CPAs to validate accounting design

- **Target:** 2 CPA consultations (1-2 hours each) to review schema, journal entry logic, and financial statement generation
- **Current:** 0 CPA consultations
- **Progress:** 0% ðŸŸ¡
- **Owner:** Chris Stephens
- **Confidence:** Medium (need to find CPAs willing to consult)

**What to Validate:**
- Chart of accounts structure (is it correct for HOAs?)
- Journal entry patterns (common transactions: dues, late fees, reserve transfers)
- Financial statement formats (are they GAAP-compliant?)
- Immutability approach (does event sourcing satisfy auditors?)
- Period close workflow (what's required for month-end/year-end?)

**Progress Updates:**
- 2025-10-27: Need to network with CPAs who work with HOAs

---

## Supporting Initiatives

Projects and work that support the OKRs but aren't KRs themselves:

- **Initiative 1: Pilot Customer Recruitment**
  - Supports: Objective 1 (need real HOAs to test with)
  - Status: Not Started
  - Action: Identify 3-5 friendly HOA boards willing to beta test
  - Timeline: Need by Week 8 (when basic system is testable)

- **Initiative 2: Database Schema Design & Migration**
  - Supports: Objective 1 (technical foundation)
  - Status: Not Started
  - Action: Design and implement multi-tenant PostgreSQL schema
  - Timeline: Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2)

- **Initiative 3: Learn PostgreSQL Multi-Tenancy Best Practices**
  - Supports: Objective 1 (technical foundation)
  - Status: Not Started
  - Action: Research schema-per-tenant vs RLS, query optimization, materialized views
  - Timeline: Ongoing during Phase 1

- **Initiative 4: Document Architecture Decisions (ADRs)**
  - Supports: Both objectives (knowledge capture)
  - Status: Not Started
  - Action: Create ADRs for: schema-per-tenant, event sourcing, Plaid integration, etc.
  - Timeline: As decisions are made during Phase 1

## Notes for Solo Founder

**Keep it simple:**
- Only 2 objectives (not 3-5 like team OKRs)
- Focus on learning and building foundation correctly
- Don't stress about hitting 1.0 on all KRs (0.7+ is great for first quarter)

**Weekly habit:**
- Every Friday: Update weekly check-in section
- Review metrics dashboard
- Adjust confidence levels based on progress

**Monthly habit:**
- End of each month: Review OKR progress
- Ask: "Am I on track for 0.7+ on each objective?"
- Adjust plan if falling behind

**Remember:**
- This is a 2-3 year product to get right
- Slow and correct > fast and broken
- Financial software has zero tolerance for errors
- Learning the domain deeply is time well spent
