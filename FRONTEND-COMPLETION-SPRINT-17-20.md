## Technical Implementation

### UI Framework & Libraries
- **React 18** with TypeScript

- **lucide-react** for icons
- **Responsive design** (mobile-friendly)
- **Color-coded badges** for statuses and severity
- **Loading states** for all data fetching
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Empty states** for all list pages

### Design Patterns
- Consistent card-based layouts
- Grid and table views where appropriate
- Action buttons positioned top-right
- Summary cards for key metrics
- Filtering and search capabilities
- Modal forms for create/edit operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### API Integration
- Centralized API clients using axios
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Async/await for all API calls
- Error handling with try/catch
- Loading states during async operations

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Sprint 17 - Delinquency
- Notice sending is UI only (needs SMTP/SendGrid integration)
- USPS tracking updates are manual (could integrate with USPS API)
- Late fee calculation is backend-only (could show preview in UI)

### Sprint 18 - Auto-Matching
- ML algorithm is placeholder (needs actual ML model training)
- Pattern learning is manual (could be automatic)
- Bulk operations not supported (could add "Accept All High Confidence")

### Sprint 19 - Violations
- Photo upload not implemented (needs file upload component)
- Hearing scheduler is basic (could integrate with calendar)
- Notice generation not implemented (could use templates)
- Compliance verification manual (could add photo comparison)

### Sprint 20 - Board Packets
- PDF generation is placeholder (needs ReportLab or WeasyPrint)
- Email sending is placeholder (needs SMTP/SendGrid integration)
- Template builder not implemented (basic selection only)
- Section ordering is fixed (could add drag-and-drop)
- PDF preview not available (would require PDF viewer component)
