## Technical Debt & Future Work

### Known Limitations

**Sprint 15 - Custom Reporting:**
- Report execution is synchronous (should be async for large datasets)
- No query timeout protection
- CSV export loads entire result set in memory

**Sprint 18 - Auto-Matching Engine:**
- ML matching algorithm is placeholder (needs implementation)
- Pattern learning is manual (should be automatic)
- No parallel matching for bulk transactions

**Sprint 20 - Board Packet Generation:**
- PDF generation is placeholder (needs library integration)
- Email sending is placeholder (needs SMTP/SendGrid integration)
- No PDF template customization

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Async Task Processing:**
   - Use Celery for report generation
   - Background PDF generation
   - Bulk transaction matching

2. **Caching Strategy:**
   - Redis for match result caching
   - Report result caching with TTL
   - Dashboard metric caching

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Database query optimization
   - Bulk operations for large datasets
   - Pagination for large reports

4. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Rate limiting on expensive endpoints
   - Query complexity limits
   - File upload size restrictions
