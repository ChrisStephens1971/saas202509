## Pain Point #1: Fund Accounting, Reserves, Audit Trail

### The Problem

**Pain:** Generic accounting stacks (QuickBooks-level) do not model operating vs reserve funding, restricted cash, or community-level liabilities.

**Impact:** High impact. High likelihood.

**Why It Matters:**
- Boards can't answer: "Can we afford this roof replacement?"
- Auditors require fund-level statements (not just consolidated)
- Reserve underfunding = special assessments = angry owners
- Legal liability if funds are commingled

### The Solution: Ledger Service

**Component:** Multi-entity, multi-fund general ledger

**Key Features:**
1. **Each HOA = tenant**
   - Complete data isolation
   - Independent chart of accounts
   - Separate financial statements

2. **Each fund = sub-ledger with its own balance sheet**
   - Operating Fund (day-to-day expenses)
   - Reserve Fund (capital projects)
   - Special Assessment Fund (one-time projects)
   - Each fund tracks: Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, Expenses

3. **Journal engine supports:**
   - Scheduled assessments (monthly dues)
   - Late fees (automatic calculation)
   - Special assessments (one-time or installment)
   - Reserve contributions (transfer from operating)
   - Inter-fund transfers (with approval workflow)

4. **Immutable audit log**
   - Event sourcing: Never delete financial records
   - Point-in-time reconstruction
   - Cryptographic hash chain for tamper detection

### How It Kills the Pain

**Board View:** Real-time answers to critical questions
- "What's our reserve balance?" → Instant answer
- "Can we afford the $50K roof project?" → Show reserve balance + reserve study
- "Are we overspending this month?" → Budget vs actual report

**Auditor View:** Full compliance
- Fund-level balance sheets on demand
- Complete transaction history with audit trail
- GAAP-compliant financial statements
- Immutable records (can't be altered after posting)

**Key Differentiator:** Separate balance sheet views
- **Board View:** Simplified, executive summary (3 fund balances)
- **Auditor View:** Full general ledger with every journal entry

---

## Pain Point #2: Bank Feeds and Payment Reconciliation

### The Problem

**Pain:** Manual reconciliation and broken bank syncs. Creates mistrust between board and management.

**Impact:** High impact. Medium likelihood.

**Why It Matters:**
- Manual reconciliation takes 4-8 hours per account per month
- Mistakes → cash discrepancies → accusations of theft
- Broken bank syncs → stale data → bad decisions
- Month-end close blocked until reconciliation complete

### The Solution: Banking + Payments Service

**Component:** Automated bank data ingestion + payment matching

**Key Features:**

1. **Direct bank data ingestion**
   - **Primary:** Plaid integration for 11,000+ banks
   - **Fallback:** Lockbox remittance file import for banks without APIs
   - Daily sync (or real-time if available)
   - Transaction deduplication

2. **Auto-match incoming payments**
   - **Rule 1:** Exact match (amount + date)
   - **Rule 2:** Fuzzy match (amount ±$1, date ±3 days)
   - **Rule 3:** Description matching (Stripe ID, check number)
   - **Rule 4:** Pattern learning (ML-powered, optional)
   - Confidence scoring (0-100%)

3. **Match targets:**
   - Invoice ID (best)
   - Property address (good)
   - Owner name (fallback)
   - Amount (last resort)
   - Fuzzy matching rules for typos and variations

4. **Escrow and reserve accounts mapped to funds**
   - Operating checking → Operating Fund
   - Reserve savings → Reserve Fund
   - Special assessment account → Special Assessment Fund
   - Prevents accidental commingling

### How It Kills the Pain

**Cash position stays current:**
- Real-time bank balance (synced hourly)
- AR aging updated as payments clear
- No waiting for month-end reconciliation

**Exception queue design:**
- **90-95% auto-matched** → No human intervention
- **5-10% likely matches** → Human clicks "approve" (30 seconds each)
- **Remaining exceptions** → Human manually matches or creates entries

**Key Feature: Exception Queue UI**
```
Unmatched Transactions (3 items)

[Bank] $250.00 - STRIPE PAYMENT pi_3A...
  → Suggested: Invoice #1234 (John Smith)
  → Confidence: 95%
  → [Match] [Skip]

[Bank] $1,000.00 - CHECK #5678
  → Suggested: Invoice #1235 (Jane Doe)
  → Confidence: 88%
  → [Match] [Skip]

[Bank] -$15.00 - BANK SERVICE FEE
  → No match found
  → [Create Expense] [Ignore]
```

**Time Savings:**
- Before: 8 hours/month reconciling manually
- After: 15 minutes/month reviewing exceptions
- **95% time reduction**

---

## Pain Point #3: Homeowner Billing, Dues, AR Aging

### The Problem

**Pain:** Boards complain they don't know who's delinquent or why. Owners complain "I never got the notice."

**Impact:** High impact. Guaranteed.

**Why It Matters:**
- Delinquent owners = cash flow problems
- Inconsistent collections = resentment from paying owners
- Lack of notice proof = disputes and legal issues
- Manual AR reports take 2 hours to generate

### The Solution: Assessment + AR Service

**Component:** Automated billing, collections workflow, notice tracking

**Key Features:**

1. **Recurring billing engine per association**
   - **Amount:** Per-unit or percentage (e.g., $300/month)
   - **Frequency:** Monthly, quarterly, annual
   - **Grace period:** Days after due date before late fee (typically 10 days)
   - **Late fee schedule:** Flat ($25) or percentage (5% of balance)
   - **Interest rules:** Compound monthly (e.g., 1.5% per month = 18% APR)
   - **Special assessments:** One-time or installment plans

2. **Owner ledger per unit/lot**
   - Current balance (positive = owed TO HOA)
   - Payment history (last 12 months)
   - Aging buckets: 0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+ days
   - Late fees accumulated
   - Last payment date and amount

3. **Delinquency status tracking**
   - **Current:** Balance ≤ $0 or within grace period
   - **Late:** Past grace period, <30 days
   - **Delinquent:** 30+ days, notices sent
   - **Lien Eligible:** Meets state requirements (amount + time)
   - **Lien Filed:** Official lien recorded with county
   - **Attorney:** Escalated to collections attorney
   - **Legal:** Foreclosure initiated (extreme cases)

4. **Lien eligibility flags (state-specific)**
   - **California:** $1,800 OR 12 months delinquent
   - **Florida:** $1,000 OR 90 days delinquent
   - **Texas:** Any amount, 30 days after pre-lien notice
   - System automatically calculates based on state

5. **Attorney escalation log**
   - Board approval tracking (who authorized, when)
   - Attorney assignment (which firm/lawyer)
   - Escalation timeline (dates, actions taken)
   - Legal fees tracking (added to owner balance)

### How It Kills the Pain

**Board gets real-time delinquency dashboard:**
- "Show me all owners >60 days delinquent" → Instant report
- "What's our total AR?" → Real-time number
- "Who's eligible for lien?" → System calculates automatically
- No waiting for staff to generate reports

**Key Feature: Certified-Notice Log**
- **Every notice recorded:**
  - Date sent
  - Delivery method (email, certified mail, hand-delivered)
  - Content (full text stored immutably)
  - Tracking number (USPS certified mail)
  - Delivery confirmation (signature, date received)
  - Email open tracking (timestamp, IP address)

- **Litigation protection:**
  - Owner says: "I never got a notice"
  - System shows: "Certified mail delivered on 2025-03-15, signed by J. Smith"
  - Attach: PDF of signed receipt

**Automated Collections Workflow:**
```
Day 0:   Invoice issued (Due: Day 10)
Day 10:  Payment due
Day 20:  Grace period ends
         → Auto-apply late fee ($25 or 5%)
         → Send first notice (email)
Day 35:  Second notice (email + certified mail)
Day 60:  Final notice (certified mail required)
         → Flag as "lien eligible" (if meets state rules)
Day 75:  Pre-lien notice (required by most states)
Day 90:  Attorney escalation
         → Board approval workflow triggered
Day 105: Lien filed (if board approves)
Day 180: Foreclosure initiation (last resort)
```

**Consistency = Higher Collection Rates:**
- Industry average: 85-92%
- With automated workflow: 96%+ (best-in-class)

## Pain Point #4: Budgeting and Reserve Planning

### The Problem

**Pain:** Boards guess. Reserves get underfunded. Capital projects blindside owners.

**Impact:** Medium impact. High likelihood.

**Why It Matters:**
- Underfunded reserves → emergency special assessments → angry owners
- No reserve study → board liability (fiduciary duty breach in some states)
- Capital projects delayed → higher costs later (deferred maintenance)
- Special assessments unpopular → board members voted out

### The Solution: Budget & Reserve Planning Module

**Component:** Multi-year planning, reserve study integration, scenario analysis

**Key Features:**

1. **Annual operating budget**
   - Line-item budget per account (landscaping, utilities, insurance, etc.)
   - Planned vs actual tracking (real-time variance)
   - Links to general ledger (automatic actuals)
   - Monthly/quarterly reports
   - Board approval workflow (track votes)

2. **5-20 year reserve forecast**
   - **Component inventory:**
     - Roofs (expected life: 20 years, cost: $150K)
     - Pavement (expected life: 15 years, cost: $80K)
     - Elevators (expected life: 25 years, cost: $60K)
     - Pool equipment (expected life: 10 years, cost: $30K)
     - Painting (expected life: 5 years, cost: $25K)

   - **For each component:**
     - Installation date (or estimated age)
     - Expected lifespan (years)
     - Expected replacement cost (today's dollars)
     - Inflation rate (default: 3% per year)
     - Current funded status

   - **Calculation engine:**
     - Future replacement cost = Current cost × (1 + inflation)^years
     - Required balance at replacement = Replacement cost
     - Current reserve balance = Actual bank balance
     - Funding deficit/surplus = Required - Current
     - Recommended monthly contribution = Deficit ÷ Months remaining

3. **Generates recommended dues increases or special assessments**
   - "To fully fund reserves, increase dues by $15/month"
   - "Or: Implement $500 special assessment to all owners"
   - "Or: Defer roof project 3 years (but dues must increase $25/month in year 4)"

### How It Kills the Pain

**Removes emotion from dues setting:**
- Board member: "We should raise dues"
- Other member: "Why? Owners will hate us"
- System: "Math says we need $12/month increase to avoid $2,000 special assessment in 2028"
- Board: "Okay, math wins"

**Key Feature: Scenario Analysis**
```
Scenario 1: Fully Fund Reserves (Recommended)
- Increase dues: $15/month per unit
- Special assessments: None projected
- Reserve balance in 2030: $450K (healthy)

Scenario 2: Defer Roof Replacement 3 Years
- Increase dues: $0/month (no change)
- Special assessments: $2,000 per unit in 2028 (roof emergency)
- Reserve balance in 2030: $180K (underfunded)

Scenario 3: Minimum Contribution (Risky)
- Increase dues: $5/month per unit
- Special assessments: $1,200 per unit in 2027 (pavement)
- Reserve balance in 2030: $250K (barely adequate)

Board: Which scenario do we approve?
```

**Visual Timeline:**
```
2025 ──────── 2026 ──────── 2027 ──────── 2028 ──────── 2029 ──────── 2030
       │               │               │               │               │
       │               Pavement        Roof            Pool            Painting
       │               $80K            $150K           $30K            $25K
       │
       Current Balance: $120K
       Projected (Scenario 1): $145K → $165K → $185K → $205K → $225K
       Projected (Scenario 2): $135K → $140K → $95K  → $100K → $105K (DANGER)
```

## Pain Point #5: Violations, Maintenance, Architectural Control, Work Orders

### The Problem

**Pain:** Operations usually lives in a separate tool or email inbox. Evidence gets lost. Accusations of favoritism.

**Impact:** Medium impact. High likelihood.

**Why It Matters:**
- Selective enforcement lawsuits ("They cited me but not my neighbor")
- Lost evidence (emails deleted, photos gone)
- Fines not collected (manual process, forgotten)
- Architectural requests lost in email chains

### The Solution: Compliance + Ops Service

**Component:** Violation tracking, ARC workflow, work order system

**Key Features:**

1. **Violation tracking**
   - **Photo evidence:** Before/during/after photos with timestamps
   - **Escalation steps:**
     - Step 1: Courtesy notice (no fine)
     - Step 2: Warning notice (7 days to cure)
     - Step 3: Fine notice ($50-500 depending on violation)
     - Step 4: Continued violation (recurring fines)
     - Step 5: Legal action (attorney escalation)
   - **Fine schedules:** Per violation type (landscaping: $50, parking: $100, noise: $200)
   - **Integration:** Fines post automatically to member ledger as receivables

2. **ARC (Architectural Review Committee) workflow**
   - **Owner submission portal:**
     - Request type (paint color, fence, landscaping, addition, etc.)
     - Photos and documents (plans, specs)
     - Contractor information
     - Proposed timeline
   - **Board review:**
     - Approve, deny, or approve with conditions
     - Conditions tracked (e.g., "Approved if fence is white, not black")
     - Email notifications at each step
   - **Completion verification:**
     - Inspector uploads completion photos
     - Owner notified of approval
     - Permanent record (for future resales)

3. **Work order and vendor ticketing**
   - **Work order creation:**
     - From resident request (self-service portal)
     - From inspection (proactive maintenance)
     - From violation (board-initiated)
   - **Assignment:**
     - Internal staff or vendor
     - Priority: Emergency, High, Medium, Low
     - Estimated cost and due date
   - **Cost codes:** Target specific GL accounts
     - Landscaping WO → Account 5100 (Landscaping Expense)
     - Pool repair WO → Account 5350 (Pool Maintenance)
     - Roof repair WO → Reserve Fund Account (if capital project)
   - **Vendor invoice matching:** Link invoice to work order, auto-approve if within estimate

### How It Kills the Pain

**Operations data is now financially accountable:**
- Fine issued → Automatically added to owner ledger
- Work order completed → Vendor invoice coded correctly
- All transactions flow into general ledger

**Key Feature: Mobile Inspector App**
- Inspector walks property with tablet/phone
- Snaps photo of violation (overgrown lawn, trash can out)
- GPS coordinates and timestamp automatically captured
- Creates violation in system with evidence
- Owner receives notice with photo within 24 hours

**Destroys "selective enforcement" claims:**
- Owner: "You never enforce violations against unit 123!"
- Board: "Here are 3 violations issued to unit 123 in the last 6 months with photos and dates"
- Proof of consistent enforcement = legal protection

---

## Pain Point #6: Communications and Portal

### The Problem

**Pain:** Email chaos. "You never told us." Owners distrust management because they feel blind. Adoption fails if the UX is bad.

**Impact:** High impact. Adoption critical.

**Why It Matters:**
- Email gets lost in spam folders
- No proof of delivery → disputes
- Owners feel excluded from decisions
- Low adoption = platform fails (no network effects)

### The Solution: Owner / Board Portal + Messaging Layer

**Component:** Secure portal, centralized communications, message logging

**Key Features:**

1. **Secure portal per owner**
   - **Personal dashboard:**
     - Current balance and payment due date
     - Recent payments (last 12 months)
     - Outstanding invoices
     - Violation status (if any)
     - Architectural requests (status tracking)
     - Work orders submitted (status updates)

   - **Document access:**
     - Meeting minutes (last 24 months)
     - Financial statements (if authorized)
     - Community rules and CC&Rs
     - Insurance certificates
     - Contracts (landscaping, pool service, etc.)

   - **Self-service actions:**
     - Make a payment (ACH or credit card)
     - Submit work order
     - Submit architectural request
     - Update contact information
     - View announcement history

2. **Discussion list and outbound messaging**
   - **Channels:**
     - Email (primary)
     - SMS (urgent only, opt-in)
     - Push notifications (mobile app)
     - In-app inbox (permanent record)

   - **Message types:**
     - Community announcements (all owners)
     - Emergency alerts (urgent)
     - Board meeting reminders
     - Payment reminders (automated)
     - Violation notices (certified tracking)

   - **All centralized and logged:**
     - Every message stored permanently
     - Delivery status tracked (sent, delivered, opened)
     - Email open tracking (timestamp, IP)
     - SMS delivery confirmation

### How It Kills the Pain

**Single source of truth:**
- Owner: "I never received the notice about the special assessment"
- System: "Email sent on 2025-02-15 at 10:32am, opened on 2025-02-15 at 11:05am from IP 192.168.1.1"
- Proof: Screenshot of email + open tracking data

**Key Feature: Owner Timeline**
- Every interaction with owner logged in one place:
  - Invoices sent
  - Payments received
  - Notices sent (with delivery confirmation)
  - Violations issued
  - Work orders submitted
  - Documents accessed
  - Messages sent/received
  - Portal login history

**Zero debate later:**
- Disputes become fact-checking, not arguments
- "When did you send that?" → "Here's the exact timestamp"
- Legal discovery = export timeline as PDF

---

## Pain Point #7: Role-Based Access and Governance

### The Problem

**Pain:** Too many people have admin rights, or not enough. Audits stall because access is political.

**Impact:** Medium impact. Compliance requirement.

**Why It Matters:**
- Internal fraud (treasurer embezzles)
- Audit failures (can't prove who approved what)
- Data breaches (too many people with financial access)
- Board turnover (former treasurer still has access)

### The Solution: Identity, Roles, and Permissions Service

**Component:** Granular RBAC, approval workflows, governance log

**Key Features:**

1. **Granular roles:**
   - **Treasurer:**
     - ✅ View and export GL detail
     - ✅ View all financial reports
     - ✅ Reconcile bank accounts
     - ❌ Cannot change AR rules
     - ❌ Cannot move reserve funds without approval

   - **Property Manager:**
     - ✅ Create work orders
     - ✅ Issue violations
     - ✅ Generate reports
     - ❌ Cannot move reserve funds
     - ❌ Cannot close accounting periods

   - **Attorney:**
     - ✅ View delinquency status for specific units only
     - ✅ View violation history for cases
     - ❌ Cannot see non-delinquent owner data
     - ❌ Cannot access financial reports

   - **Owner:**
     - ✅ View own balance, payments, invoices
     - ✅ Submit work orders and ARC requests
     - ❌ Cannot see other owners' data
     - ❌ Cannot access financial reports

2. **Approval workflows:**
   - Reserve fund transfer: Requires treasurer + board president approval
   - Attorney escalation: Requires board vote (3 of 5 members)
   - Lien filing: Requires board resolution + attorney review
   - Period close: Requires accountant validation + treasurer approval

3. **Immutable governance log:**
   - Every privileged action logged:
     - Who: User ID, name, email
     - What: Action taken (closed period, transferred funds, filed lien)
     - When: Timestamp (to the second)
     - Why: Reason/notes (required for sensitive actions)
     - How: Approval chain (who approved, when)

   - **Cannot be deleted or altered:**
     - Audit trail for litigation
     - Compliance (SOC 2, GAAP)
     - Board accountability

### How It Kills the Pain

**Reduces internal fraud:**
- Treasurer can view financial data but can't transfer funds alone
- Board president can approve transfers but can't initiate them
- Two-person integrity (like nuclear launch codes)

**Supports audit without political issues:**
- Auditor: "Show me all reserve fund transfers in 2025"
- System: Export CSV with: date, amount, from fund, to fund, approved by (names), board resolution reference
- No politics, just data

**Key Feature: Role Templates**
- Onboard new board member: Assign "Board Member" role
- System automatically grants: View financials, vote on resolutions, receive board emails
- No manual permission configuration (reduces errors)

---

## Pain Point #8: Data Import and Migration

### The Problem

**Pain:** Moving from spreadsheets or legacy vendor software is usually expensive and error-prone. Associations feel trapped.

**Impact:** Critical for customer acquisition. High cost.

**Why It Matters:**
- Every prospect has existing data (QuickBooks, Excel, legacy HOA software)
- Manual data entry = weeks of work = expensive onboarding
- Errors in migration = lost trust = churn
- "We can't switch because migration is too hard" = lost sales

### The Solution: Migration + Validation Service

**Component:** Automated import, validation, parallel running

**Key Features:**

1. **CSV/Excel/XML importer with field mapping**
   - **Supported sources:**
     - QuickBooks (IIF, QBO export)
     - Excel spreadsheets (flexible column mapping)
     - Legacy HOA software (AppFolio, Buildium, Vantaca)
     - Generic CSV (user maps columns)

   - **Data types to import:**
     - Owner roster (names, addresses, unit numbers)
     - Opening balances (per owner, per account)
     - AR aging (who owes what)
     - Vendor list (for work orders)
     - Reserve balances (by fund)
     - Chart of accounts (account numbers, names, types)
     - Historical transactions (last 12 months minimum)

2. **Automated validation pass:**
   - **Check 1:** Opening trial balance by fund ties to bank statements
     - System calculates: Opening Balance + Transactions = Ending Balance
     - Compare to: Bank statement ending balance
     - Flag variances >$1.00

   - **Check 2:** AR aging ties to owner ledgers
     - Sum of all owner balances = Total AR in general ledger
     - Flag discrepancies

   - **Check 3:** Data completeness
     - All owners have unit numbers?
     - All transactions have dates?
     - All accounts have account types?
     - All invoices have amounts?

   - **Check 4:** Data validity
     - Dates in reasonable range? (not 1900-01-01 or 2099-12-31)
     - Amounts positive? (no negative invoices)
     - All required fields present?

3. **Validation report:**
   ```
   Migration Validation Report

   ✓ 1,234 invoices imported successfully
   ✓ 567 payments imported successfully
   ⚠ 12 invoices missing customer ID → Assigned to "Unknown" (review required)
   ✗ 3 payments with invalid dates (2025-13-01) → Skipped
   ⚠ Opening balance variance: $45.23 (AR in GL vs sum of owner ledgers)

   Action Required:
   1. Review 12 invoices with unknown customers
   2. Fix 3 payment dates in source data
   3. Investigate $45.23 variance (likely rounding)

   [Download Error Report CSV] [Fix Errors] [Approve Import]
   ```

### How It Kills the Pain

**Migration goes from 3-month nightmare to 1-week project:**
- Before: Manually enter 5 years of data = 200 hours = $20K cost
- After: Upload CSV, map fields, validate, import = 8 hours = $800 cost
- **95% time reduction**

**Key Feature: Parallel Period Mode**
- Month 1: Customer runs QuickBooks (primary) + our system (shadow)
- We import daily and run reports
- Compare outputs: Do balance sheets match? Income statements? AR aging?
- Flag variances for manual review
- Build trust before cutover

- Month 2: Customer switches to our system (primary)
- QuickBooks kept for reference
- If issues found: Can switch back (safety net)

**Onboarding becomes scalable:**
- Not bespoke consulting (unique process per customer)
- Standardized import process (repeatable)
- Self-service for simple migrations
- White-glove for complex migrations (but still <1 week)

## Pain Point #9: Reporting and Audit Output

### The Problem

**Pain:** Boards and auditors always want slightly different slices. Staff waste hours generating PDFs.

**Impact:** Medium impact. Time sink.

**Why It Matters:**
- Board meeting: "Can we get the report sorted by account instead of date?"
- Staff: "That will take 2 hours to recreate"
- Auditor: "We need the same report but for 2023 instead of 2024"
- Staff: "Another 2 hours"

### The Solution: Reporting and Disclosure Layer

**Component:** Prebuilt reports, customizable exports, self-service access

**Key Features:**

1. **Prebuilt board packet** (one-click generation)
   - **Contents:**
     - Income statement (YTD vs budget, variance analysis)
     - Balance sheet by fund (operating, reserve, special assessment)
     - AR aging (summary by aging bucket)
     - Reserve forecast (5-year projection)
     - Violation summary (open violations by type)
     - Work order summary (open WOs by status)
     - Bank reconciliation status (last reconciled date per account)

   - **Format options:**
     - PDF (for email/printing)
     - Excel (for board treasurer to analyze)
     - Web view (secure link, no download)

   - **Scheduling:**
     - Auto-generate on day 5 of each month
     - Email to board members automatically
     - Archive in document library

2. **Audit export** (comprehensive, immutable)
   - **Full transaction ledger:**
     - Every journal entry (all time or date range)
     - All journal entry lines (account, debit, credit, description)
     - Sorted by entry date and entry number
     - Includes: Entry type, posted date, posted by (user name)

   - **Evidence links:**
     - Invoices: Link to PDF
     - Payments: Link to bank transaction
     - Bank transactions: Link to Plaid data
     - Notices: Link to delivery confirmation

   - **Format:** CSV (for auditor to import into their tools)

   - **Immutable:** Cannot be altered after export (timestamped, hashed)

3. **Owner disclosure package for home sales**
   - **Required for resale in most states:**
     - Dues status (current, delinquent, amount owed)
     - Pending special assessments (approved but not yet billed)
     - Violations (open or resolved in last 12 months)
     - Architectural requests (approved in last 24 months)
     - HOA rules and CC&Rs (current version)
     - Financial statements (last fiscal year)
     - Reserve study (if available)
     - Insurance certificate (liability and property)

   - **Automated generation:**
     - Title company requests via web form
     - System generates PDF package
     - Payment processed ($50-200 fee, varies by state)
     - Secure link sent to title company (expires in 30 days)

   - **Time-bound disclosure links:**
     - Link expires after 30 days or after home sale closes
     - Prevents stale data (if sale falls through)
     - Audit trail: Who accessed, when, from what IP

### How It Kills the Pain

**System ships answers instead of staff assembling answers:**
- Board meeting prep: 15 minutes (generate packet, review)
- Before: 4 hours (pull data from 3 systems, format in Excel, create PDF)

**Key Feature: Self-Service Portal for Board**
- Board member logs in
- Selects: "Balance Sheet, December 2025, Operating Fund only, PDF"
- System generates in 5 seconds
- Downloads PDF
- No staff involvement needed

**Disclosure package = revenue stream:**
- Title companies pay $100-200 per package
- System generates automatically (zero marginal cost)
- 50 sales per year × $150 = $7,500 revenue
- Helps offset platform costs for small HOAs

## Pain Point #10: Pricing and Scaling Model

### The Problem

**Pain:** Cost per door balloons and nobody knows what is actually being paid for.

**Impact:** Critical for business model.

**Why It Matters:**
- Unpredictable pricing = budget surprises = churn
- Per-door pricing penalizes large HOAs (cost goes up with scale)
- Bundled pricing = paying for features you don't use
- No transparency = distrust

### The Solution: Tenant Isolation + Metering Layer

**Component:** Multi-tenant architecture, modular pricing, transparent metering

**Key Features:**

1. **Multi-tenant architecture**
   - Each HOA = logically isolated (schema-per-tenant)
   - Runs on shared infrastructure (cost efficiency)
   - Scales from 35-unit HOA to 5,000-unit management company
   - Same codebase serves all customer sizes

2. **Metering on:**
   - **Number of units:** $2-5 per unit per month (tiered)
   - **Number of bank accounts synced:** $10 per account per month (Plaid cost)
   - **Storage:** $0.10 per GB per month (documents, photos)
   - **E-billing volume:** $0.25 per invoice sent (email/SMS)
   - **API calls:** $0.001 per API call (for integrations)

3. **Tiered pricing example:**
   ```
   Tier 1: 1-50 units
   - $5 per unit per month = $250/month base
   - Includes: 2 bank accounts, 10GB storage, 200 invoices/month

   Tier 2: 51-200 units
   - $3 per unit per month = $600/month base (for 200 units)
   - Includes: 5 bank accounts, 50GB storage, 1,000 invoices/month

   Tier 3: 201-1,000 units
   - $2 per unit per month = $2,000/month base (for 1,000 units)
   - Includes: 10 bank accounts, 250GB storage, 5,000 invoices/month

   Enterprise: 1,001+ units
   - Custom pricing
   - Dedicated database
   - White-label options
   ```

4. **Modular upsell** (à la carte features)
   - **Core (Included):** Accounting + Portal + Banking
   - **Add-On 1:** Compliance + Work Orders (+$50/month)
   - **Add-On 2:** Advanced Budgeting + Reserve Planning (+$75/month)
   - **Add-On 3:** Violation Tracking + ARC Workflow (+$50/month)
   - **Add-On 4:** Owner mobile app (+$100/month)
   - **Add-On 5:** API access for integrations (+$200/month)

### How It Kills the Pain

**Predictable pricing:**
- Small self-managed HOA (35 units): $250/month (affordable)
- Mid-size HOA (150 units): $500/month (scales reasonably)
- Large management company (5,000 units): $10,000/month (but managing 50 HOAs)

**Clear unit economics:**
- Customer knows: "We're paying $3 per unit, makes sense"
- Not: "We're paying $5,000/month for... what exactly?"

**Key Feature: Real-Time Usage Dashboard**
- Customer sees: "You've used 850 of 1,000 included invoices this month"
- Overage warning: "You're on track to exceed your plan by 200 invoices ($50 overage)"
- Option to upgrade: "Upgrade to next tier for $100/month more (includes 5,000 invoices)"

**Allows segmentation:**
- Small HOA: Core only ($250/month)
- Large management company: Core + all add-ons ($10,500/month)
- Same product, different packaging

## Cost and Build Scope Summary

### MVP to Prove Value (Phase 1)

**Core Components:**
1. Ledger Service (fund accounting, journal entries, trial balance)
2. Banking + Payments (Plaid integration, auto-matching, reconciliation)
3. AR Service (invoices, aging, delinquency tracking, notice log)
4. Portal (owner/board login, payment, document access)

**Timeline:** 40-50 weeks (10-12 months) for solo founder

**Why This Proves Value:**
- Solves the 3 highest-impact pain points (accounting, reconciliation, AR/collections)
- Directly hits board/treasurer pain (not just operational staff)
- Differentiates from competitors (most focus on operations, not accounting)

### Phase 2: Operational Features (3-6 months)

**Components:**
1. Compliance + Ops Service (violations, work orders, ARC)
2. Reserve Planning Module (multi-year forecasting, scenario analysis)

**Why This Wins Larger Customers:**
- Management companies need full operational suite
- Larger HOAs (500+ units) need violation tracking
- Professional managers demand work order system

### Phase 3: Retention Features (3-6 months)

**Components:**
1. Automated board packets (one-click generation)
2. Auditor exports (full ledger with evidence links)
3. Resale disclosure packages (revenue stream)
4. Advanced reporting (custom report builder)
5. Mobile apps (iOS/Android for owners)

**Why This Locks In Retention:**
- Board packets save 4 hours per month (sticky)
- Auditor exports = compliance (switching cost)
- Disclosure packages = passive revenue
- Mobile apps = owner adoption (network effects)

## Questions to Answer Before Building

1. **Target Market:**
   - Self-managed HOAs (board members do accounting) or managed HOAs (property manager company)?
   - Small (<100 units), mid-size (100-500 units), or large (500+ units)?
   - Geographic focus (state-specific regulations)?

2. **Competitive Positioning:**
   - Compete on accounting rigor (vs AppFolio, Buildium) or ease of use (vs QuickBooks)?
   - Price point: Budget ($100-300/month), mid-market ($300-1,000/month), or enterprise ($1,000+/month)?
   - Differentiation: Fund accounting, bank reconciliation, or something else?

3. **Go-to-Market:**
   - Direct sales (founder selling), channel partners (property managers), or product-led growth (self-service)?
   - How to acquire first 10 customers? (Pilot program, referrals, paid ads?)

4. **Technical Depth:**
   - Build full accounting system in-house or integrate with QuickBooks/Xero?
   - Build Plaid integration or use third-party bank aggregator?
   - Build from scratch or use open-source accounting library (e.g., LedgerSMB)?
