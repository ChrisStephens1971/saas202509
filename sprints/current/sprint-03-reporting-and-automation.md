---

## ðŸŽ‰ Sprint Completion Summary

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-27
**Actual Duration:** 1 day (planned: 1 day)
**Completion Rate:** 100% of high-priority stories

### What We Built

**Late Fee Automation:**
- `calculate_late_fee()` method on Invoice model - Calculates late fees with configurable grace period and rates
- `apply_late_fee()` method - Applies late fee, creates invoice line, and posts journal entry
- Management command: `apply_late_fees` - Batch process for applying late fees to all overdue invoices
- Automatic journal entry creation: DR: AR (1200), CR: Late Fee Revenue (4200)
- Configurable parameters: grace period (default: 5 days), percentage (default: 5%), minimum fee (default: $25)

**AR Aging Report:**
- Management command: `ar_aging_report` - Comprehensive aging report with all owners
- Aging buckets: Current, 1-30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, 90+ days
- Summary statistics with percentage breakdown
- CSV export functionality for Excel analysis
- Detail mode showing individual invoices per owner

**Owner Ledger:**
- Management command: `owner_ledger` - Complete transaction history for an owner
- Chronological listing of all invoices and payments
- Running balance calculation
- Unapplied credit tracking
- Aging breakdown for current balance
- Account status indicators (Paid in Full, Balance Due, Overdue)

**Invoice PDF Generation:**
- `generate_pdf()` method on Invoice model - PDF generation using ReportLab
- `generate_text_invoice()` method - Text-based fallback (no external dependencies)
- Professional formatting with HOA branding
- Line-item detail with subtotals and totals
- Payment instructions included

**Support Infrastructure:**
- PDF generator module: `accounting/pdf_generator.py`
- Late fee configuration stored in method parameters (ready for settings migration)

## Technical Design

### Late Fee Calculation

**Business Rules:**
- Late fee applies after grace period (e.g., 5 days after due date)
- Late fee amount: configurable (% of balance or fixed amount)
- Late fee creates new invoice line on existing invoice
- Late fee triggers journal entry: DR: AR, CR: Late Fee Revenue

**Implementation:**
- Add `calculate_late_fee()` method to Invoice model
- Add management command: `apply_late_fees`
- Run nightly via cron to check overdue invoices

### AR Aging Report

**Report Structure:**
```
Owner               Current    1-30 Days   31-60 Days   61-90 Days   90+ Days    Total
Alice Johnson       $0.00      $0.00       $0.00        $0.00        $0.00       $0.00
Bob Williams        $0.00      $200.00     $0.00        $0.00        $0.00       $200.00
Carol Davis         $0.00      $0.00       $0.00        $0.00        $0.00       $0.00
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL               $0.00      $200.00     $0.00        $0.00        $0.00       $200.00
```

**Implementation:**
- Reuse existing `Invoice.aging_bucket` property
- Create Django view or API endpoint
- Support CSV export for Excel analysis

### Owner Ledger

**Ledger Format:**
```
OWNER LEDGER - Alice Johnson
Unit: 101

Date        Type        Number      Description                 Charges    Payments   Balance
2025-11-01  Invoice     INV-00001   November Assessment         $400.00               $400.00
2025-11-05  Payment     PMT-00001   Check #1001                            $400.00    $0.00
2025-12-01  Invoice     INV-00006   December Assessment         $400.00               $400.00
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    TOTAL                       $800.00    $400.00    $400.00
```

**Implementation:**
- Create `OwnerLedgerView` Django view
- Query all invoices and payments for owner
- Sort by date chronologically
- Calculate running balance

### Invoice PDF Generation

**PDF Contents:**
- HOA logo and letterhead
- Invoice number, date, due date
- Owner name and mailing address
- Unit number and property address
- Line items with descriptions and amounts
- Subtotal, late fees, total amount
- Payment instructions (check, ACH, online portal)

**Technology:**
- Use ReportLab or WeasyPrint (HTML to PDF)
- Template-based generation
- Store PDFs in media/ folder
- Serve via Django view with authentication

## Wins & Learnings

### What Went Well
- **All core features completed** - Late fees, AR aging, owner ledger, and PDF generation all working
- **Leveraged existing properties** - Reused Invoice.aging_bucket property across all reports
- **Professional output** - Reports are formatted professionally and ready for production use
- **Comprehensive testing** - All features tested with real data from Sprint 2
- **Flexible architecture** - Late fee parameters are configurable, ready for settings/config migration
- **Error handling** - Fixed queryset filtering issues with property-based filters

### What Could Be Improved
- **ReportLab dependency** - PDF generation requires external library; text fallback provided
- **Configuration hardcoding** - Late fee parameters are method arguments; should move to database settings
- **Report scheduling** - No automated scheduling yet (requires cron/Celery setup)
- **Email integration** - Invoice PDFs can be generated but not yet emailed to owners

### Action Items for Next Sprint
- [ ] Move late fee configuration to database settings table
- [ ] Set up automated late fee batch job (cron or Celery)
- [ ] Implement email delivery for invoice PDFs
- [ ] Create web-based dashboard for reports (Django views/API endpoints)
- [ ] Add payment batch import from CSV (ACH/bank files)
- [ ] Build revenue recognition tracking (for prepaid assessments)

## Notes

**Late Fee Best Practices:**
- Always check state/local laws for maximum late fee amounts
- Grace period is typically 5-10 days after due date
- Late fees should be reasonable (e.g., 5% or $25, whichever is greater)
- Document late fee policy in HOA bylaws

**Reporting Performance:**
- AR aging report should cache results for large HOAs (>500 units)
- Consider database indexes on invoice_date, due_date, owner_id
- Use select_related() and prefetch_related() to avoid N+1 queries

**PDF Generation:**
- PDFs should be generated on-demand, not stored (unless required for compliance)
- Consider background task queue (Celery) for batch PDF generation
- Use consistent branding across all PDFs
