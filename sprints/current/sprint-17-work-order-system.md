# Sprint 17 - Work Order System with Vendor Management

**Sprint Duration:** TBD (2 weeks estimated)
**Sprint Goal:** Implement work order and vendor management system with cost tracking and GL integration
**Status:** Planning

---

## Sprint Goal

Build a work order system that enables HOAs to track maintenance requests, assign work to vendors or staff, monitor completion, and automatically code expenses to the correct general ledger accounts. This creates financial accountability for all operational spending and provides a complete audit trail from request to payment.

Key features:
- Work order creation (from residents or proactive maintenance)
- Vendor directory and assignment
- Priority and status tracking
- Cost estimation and actual cost capture
- GL account coding for expenses
- Invoice matching (link vendor invoice to work order)

## Sprint Capacity

**Available Days:** 10 working days
**Capacity:** 60-80 hours
**Commitments/Time Off:** None

## Integration Requirements

### Accounting Integration (US-182)

When work order is completed and invoice approved:

1. **Create JournalEntry:**
   ```
   Debit:  Landscaping Expense (5100) - $500.00
   Credit: Accounts Payable (2100) - $500.00
   ```

2. **Link WorkOrderInvoice to JournalEntry**
   - WorkOrderInvoice.journal_entry = JournalEntry.id
   - WorkOrder.actual_cost = Invoice.amount

3. **Fund allocation:**
   - Operating work orders ‚Üí Operating Fund
   - Capital projects (roof, pavement) ‚Üí Reserve Fund
   - Special projects ‚Üí Special Assessment Fund

4. **GL account mapping:**
   - Category determines default account
   - Manager can override if needed
   - Examples:
     - Landscaping ‚Üí 5100 (Landscaping Expense)
     - Pool Maintenance ‚Üí 5350 (Pool/Spa Expense)
     - Plumbing ‚Üí 5200 (Repairs & Maintenance)
     - HVAC ‚Üí 5210 (HVAC Maintenance)

### Email Notifications

**Owner receives (if they submitted):**
- Confirmation: "Your work request has been received"
- Assigned: "A vendor has been assigned to your request"
- Completed: "Your work request has been completed"

**Vendor receives:**
- Assignment: "You have been assigned work order #WO-2025-001"
- Updates: "Owner added a comment to your work order"

**Management receives:**
- New request: "New work request from owner"
- Completed: "Work order completed, ready for review"
- Over budget: "Work order cost exceeds estimate by $X"

### Owner Portal Integration

- Owners can view their submitted work orders
- Status tracking (real-time updates)
- Communication with management (comments)
- Photo upload (show the problem)
- Completion notification

## Success Metrics

**MVP Success Criteria:**
- 30+ work orders created in pilot HOA
- 100% of completed work orders coded to GL
- Average response time <24 hours for high priority
- 80%+ owner satisfaction with work request process
- Board reports "better vendor tracking" in feedback

## Notes

**Common Work Order Categories:**
1. **Landscaping:** Mowing, trimming, irrigation, tree removal
2. **Pool/Spa:** Pump repair, cleaning, chemical balance
3. **Building Maintenance:** Painting, repairs, cleaning
4. **Plumbing:** Leaks, clogs, pipe repairs
5. **Electrical:** Lighting, outlets, circuit issues
6. **HVAC:** Heating, cooling, ventilation
7. **Security:** Gate repairs, lock changes, camera issues
8. **Pest Control:** Regular service, emergency treatment

**Vendor Management Best Practices:**
- Collect W-9 for tax reporting
- Verify insurance annually
- Check license status
- Track performance (on-time, quality, cost)
- Maintain contact list for emergencies

**Future Enhancements (Post-Sprint):**
- Preventive maintenance scheduling (quarterly pool service, annual HVAC)
- Vendor bidding (multiple vendors quote on work order)
- Warranty tracking (equipment under warranty)
- Asset management integration (link work orders to assets like pool pump)
- Mobile app for vendors (update status from field)

**Integration with Other Modules:**
- Violation ‚Üí Work Order: "Fix this violation" creates work order
- ARC ‚Üí Work Order: "Complete approved modification" creates work order
- Reserve Planning ‚Üí Work Order: "Schedule roof replacement" creates capital work order
