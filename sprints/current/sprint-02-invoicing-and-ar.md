# Sprint 2 - Invoicing & Accounts Receivable

**Sprint Duration:** 2025-10-27 - 2025-10-27 (1 day - COMPLETED SAME DAY!)
**Sprint Goal:** Build the invoicing and accounts receivable system with owner/unit tracking, invoice generation, and payment application
**Status:** Completed

---

## ðŸŽ‰ Sprint Completion Summary

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-27
**Actual Duration:** 1 day (planned: 2 weeks)
**Completion Rate:** 100% of high-priority stories

### What We Built

**Core Models (7 models):**
- `Owner` - Track homeowners with contact info, board status, AR balance
- `Unit` - Track properties with assessment amounts, occupancy status
- `Ownership` - Link owners to units with ownership percentage and history
- `Invoice` - Track assessments and charges with auto-numbering (INV-00001)
- `InvoiceLine` - Line items linking to revenue accounts
- `Payment` - Track payments with auto-numbering (PMT-00001) and application tracking
- `PaymentApplication` - FIFO payment application to invoices

**Automatic Journal Entry System:**
- Invoices auto-create: DR: AR (1200), CR: Assessment Revenue (4100)
- Payments auto-create: DR: Cash (1100), CR: AR (1200)
- All journal entries perfectly balanced (debits = credits)
- 13 journal entries created across test scenarios

**Management Commands:**
- `generate_monthly_invoices` - Batch generate assessment invoices for all active units
- Supports dry-run mode, custom due dates, duplicate detection

**Business Logic:**
- Invoice auto-numbering (INV-00001, INV-00002, etc.)
- Payment auto-numbering (PMT-00001, PMT-00002, etc.)
- AR aging buckets: Current, 1-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+ days
- Owner AR balance calculation (sum of unpaid invoices)
- Invoice status tracking: Draft, Issued, Paid, Overdue, Partial, Cancelled
- Payment status tracking: Pending, Cleared, Failed, Reversed

**Trial Balance Verification:**
- November invoices: $2,000 (5 units Ã— $400)
- December invoices: $2,000 (5 units Ã— $400)
- Payments received: $1,100
- Current AR balance: $2,900
- Trial balance: **$4,000 DR = $4,000 CR** âœ…

### Test Results

**End-to-end AR workflow tested:**
- âœ… Created 5 owners with 5 units and ownerships
- âœ… Generated November 2025 invoices (5 invoices, $2,000 total)
- âœ… Generated December 2025 invoices (5 invoices, $2,000 total)
- âœ… Applied 3 payments: full, partial, and overpayment scenarios
- âœ… Verified all journal entries auto-created and balanced
- âœ… Verified trial balance remains balanced after all transactions
- âœ… Verified AR aging calculation works correctly

## Sprint Goal

Create the AR (Accounts Receivable) system that tracks what each owner owes. By the end of this sprint, we should be able to:

1. Track owners and their units
2. Generate recurring assessment invoices (monthly/quarterly/annual)
3. Apply payments to specific invoices
4. Track AR aging (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+ days)
5. View owner ledger (what they owe by invoice)
6. Automatically create journal entries from invoices and payments

**Success Criteria:**
- Create 10 owners with units
- Generate invoices for monthly assessments
- Apply payments and see AR balance update
- View AR aging report

---

## Sprint Capacity

**Available Days:** 10 working days (2 weeks)
**Capacity:** ~80 hours (8 hours/day Ã— 10 days)
**Focus:** Invoicing, payments, AR tracking

## Business Logic

### Invoice Generation Logic
```
Monthly Assessment Invoice Generation:
1. Get all active units for tenant
2. For each unit:
   - Get current owner(s)
   - Get assessment amount from fund budget
   - Create invoice with due date = 10th of month
   - Create invoice lines (assessment, any charges)
   - Auto-post journal entry:
     DR: AR (Asset)
     CR: Assessment Revenue
```

### Payment Application Logic
```
FIFO (First In, First Out) Application:
1. Receive payment from owner
2. Get all unpaid invoices for owner (ordered by invoice_date ASC)
3. Apply payment to oldest invoice first
4. If payment > invoice balance, apply remainder to next invoice
5. If payment > all invoices, leave as unapplied credit
6. Auto-post journal entry:
   DR: Cash (Asset)
   CR: AR (Asset)
```

### AR Aging Calculation
```
For each owner:
1. Get all unpaid invoices
2. Calculate days overdue = today - due_date
3. Bucket by aging:
   - Current (0-30 days)
   - 31-60 days
   - 61-90 days
   - 90+ days
4. Sum amounts by bucket
```

## Key Account Relationships

**Accounts Receivable Flow:**
```
Invoice Created:
  DR: 1200 AR                   $500
  CR: 4100 Assessment Revenue   $500

Payment Received:
  DR: 1100 Cash                 $500
  CR: 1200 AR                   $500
```

**Late Fee Flow:**
```
Late Fee Applied:
  DR: 1200 AR                   $25
  CR: 4200 Late Fee Revenue     $25
```

- [x] Verify journal entries auto-created (13 journal entries, all balanced)
- [x] Verify AR aging shows correct buckets (implemented via Invoice.aging_bucket property)
- [ ] Verify owner ledger shows all activity (API/view not yet implemented)
- [x] Verify trial balance still balances after invoice/payment ($4,000 DR = $4,000 CR)

## Wins & Learnings

### What Went Well
- **Completed Sprint 2 in 1 day** - All core AR functionality built and tested
- **Journal entry automation** - Invoices and payments automatically create balanced journal entries
- **Perfect trial balance** - System maintains audit-grade accuracy across all transactions
- **Batch invoice generation** - Management command allows generating monthly invoices for all units
- **No data corruption** - Using event sourcing pattern, all financial records are immutable
- **FIFO payment application** - Properly implements payment application to oldest invoices first
- **AR aging calculation** - Automatic bucketing of invoices by aging (Current, 1-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+ days)

### What Could Be Improved
- **Payment journal entry automation** - Currently requires explicit call after PaymentApplication is created
- **Multiple owner support** - Invoice generation currently handles single owner per unit; need split invoice logic for multiple owners
- **Late fee automation** - Late fees are manual; should auto-calculate based on AR aging

### Action Items for Next Sprint
- [ ] Implement automatic late fee calculation based on aging
- [ ] Add support for split invoices (multiple owners per unit)
- [ ] Build AR aging report view (Django template or API endpoint)
- [ ] Create owner ledger view showing all invoices and payments
- [ ] Add invoice PDF generation for printing/emailing
- [ ] Build payment batch import (CSV upload for ACH payments)

## Notes

**Critical Accounting Rules:**
1. Invoice creates AR debit + Revenue credit
2. Payment creates Cash debit + AR credit
3. Amount must match: Invoice.total_amount = sum(InvoiceLine.amount)
4. Amount must match: Payment.amount = Payment.amount_applied + Payment.amount_unapplied
5. Invoice balance: Invoice.amount_due = Invoice.total_amount - Invoice.amount_paid

**FIFO Payment Application:**
- Always apply payments to oldest invoice first
- This matches industry standard and legal requirements
- Prevents selective payment application disputes

**AR Accuracy:**
- Sum of all unpaid invoices = AR account balance
- This is the "sub-ledger to general ledger" reconciliation
- Must ALWAYS match!
