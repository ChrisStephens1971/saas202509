# Sprint 16 - Architectural Review Committee (ARC) Workflow

**Sprint Duration:** TBD (2 weeks estimated)
**Sprint Goal:** Implement ARC workflow for homeowner architectural modification requests with approval tracking and compliance verification
**Status:** Planning

---

## Sprint Goal

Build an Architectural Review Committee (ARC) workflow system that enables homeowners to submit modification requests (paint, fencing, landscaping, additions) with documentation, allows board/committee review and approval, tracks conditions, and verifies completion. This prevents unauthorized modifications and provides permanent records for property history.

Key features:
- Owner self-service request submission portal
- Document upload (plans, specs, contractor info)
- Multi-reviewer approval workflow
- Conditional approval tracking
- Completion verification with photos
- Permanent record for resale disclosures

## Sprint Capacity

**Available Days:** 10 working days
**Capacity:** 60-80 hours
**Commitments/Time Off:** None

## Workflow States

### Request Lifecycle

```
Draft ‚Üí Submitted ‚Üí Under Review ‚Üí Approved/Denied ‚Üí Completed
                                 ‚Üò Approved with Conditions ‚Üí Completed
```

**Draft:**
- Owner creating request
- Can save and edit
- Not visible to committee

**Submitted:**
- Owner submitted for review
- Visible to committee
- Cannot be edited by owner

**Under Review:**
- One or more committee members reviewing
- Comments and questions allowed
- Owner can respond to questions

**Approved:**
- Committee approved without conditions
- Owner can proceed
- Expiration date set (typically 12 months)

**Approved with Conditions:**
- Approved BUT owner must meet conditions
- Conditions documented (e.g., "fence must be white")
- Inspection required upon completion

**Denied:**
- Committee denied request
- Reason required
- Owner can appeal or resubmit with changes

**Completed:**
- Work finished
- Inspector verified compliance
- Permanent record created

**Cancelled:**
- Owner cancelled request
- Or expired (not started within 12 months)

---

## Multi-Reviewer Logic

**Option 1: Unanimous Approval Required**
- All committee members must approve
- One "deny" = request denied
- Simple but strict

**Option 2: Majority Vote**
- 3+ reviewers required
- Majority approve = approved
- More flexible

**MVP Decision: Simple Single Approver**
- One designated committee chair or board president
- Other committee members can comment
- Only chair can approve/deny
- Simplifies workflow for MVP

---

## Integration Requirements

### Email Notifications

Send email at each status change:

**Owner receives:**
- Confirmation: "Your request has been submitted"
- Under review: "Your request is being reviewed"
- Approved: "Your request has been approved - see conditions"
- Denied: "Your request has been denied - see reason"
- Expiring: "Your approval expires in 30 days"

**Committee receives:**
- New submission: "New ARC request requires review"
- Comment added: "Owner responded to your question"

### Document Storage

- Local filesystem for MVP (organize by tenant/request)
- S3 for production (scalable, durable)
- Max file size: 25MB per file
- Supported formats: PDF, JPG, PNG, DWG (AutoCAD)
- Retention: Permanent (needed for resale disclosures)

### Violation Integration (Future)

- Unapproved modifications ‚Üí Automatic violation
- If work starts without ARC approval ‚Üí Flag as violation
- Connects to Sprint 15 (Violation Tracking)

## Success Metrics

**MVP Success Criteria:**
- 10+ ARC requests submitted in pilot HOA
- 100% of requests reviewed within 30 days
- 0 unauthorized modifications (all go through ARC)
- Document retention working (permanent records)
- Board reports "easier to track modifications" in feedback

---

## Notes

**Common Request Types:**
1. **Exterior Paint:** Most common, usually approved quickly
2. **Fencing:** Requires plans, height/material restrictions
3. **Landscaping:** Trees, shrubs, hardscaping
4. **Solar Panels:** Increasingly common, legal restrictions on denial
5. **Room Additions:** Complex, requires architectural plans
6. **Windows/Doors:** Style and color restrictions
7. **Roofing:** Material and color matching

**Legal Considerations:**
- **Solar Rights:** California law limits HOA ability to deny solar panels
- **Reasonable Restrictions:** HOAs can't be arbitrary or discriminatory
- **Timeliness:** Many states require response within 30-60 days
- **Documentation:** Permanent records protect both owner and HOA

**Owner Portal Integration:**
- ARC request submission available in owner portal
- Status tracking visible to owner
- Document download (approved plans for contractor)
- Completion photos upload (owner can self-report completion)

**Future Enhancements (Post-Sprint):**
- Recurring approvals (same request type, multiple owners)
- Template library (pre-approved paint colors, fence styles)
- Integration with architectural guidelines (auto-deny if violates rules)
- Property history report (all modifications over time)
