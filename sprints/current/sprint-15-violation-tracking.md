# Sprint 15 - Violation Tracking System

**Sprint Duration:** TBD (2 weeks estimated)
**Sprint Goal:** Implement comprehensive violation tracking with photo evidence, escalation workflow, and fine automation
**Status:** Planning

---

## Sprint Goal

Build a violation tracking system that enables HOAs to consistently enforce community rules with documented evidence, automated escalation, and fine integration with the accounting ledger. This addresses a critical HOA need: protecting boards from selective enforcement lawsuits while automating fine collection.

Key features:
- Violation creation with photo evidence
- Multi-step escalation workflow (courtesy ‚Üí warning ‚Üí fine ‚Üí legal)
- Fine schedules per violation type
- Automatic posting of fines to owner ledgers
- Evidence preservation with timestamps and GPS coordinates

## Sprint Capacity

**Available Days:** 10 working days
**Capacity:** 60-80 hours
**Commitments/Time Off:** None

## Integration Requirements

### Accounting Integration

When fine is posted (US-156):
1. Create Invoice record linked to owner/unit
2. Create JournalEntry:
   - Debit: Accounts Receivable (1200) - $50.00
   - Credit: Violation Fee Revenue (4500) - $50.00
3. Link ViolationFine to Invoice and JournalEntry
4. Update owner ledger balance

### Email Notifications

Violation notices sent via existing EmailService:
- Courtesy notice: "You have a violation - please cure by {due_date}"
- Warning notice: "Final warning - cure by {due_date} or fine will be assessed"
- Fine notice: "Fine of ${amount} has been posted to your account"
- Include: Photos, description, cure instructions, contact info

## Technical Debt / Maintenance

- [ ] Add photo compression to reduce storage costs
- [ ] Implement photo retention policy (delete after X years?)
- [ ] Add role-based access control (inspector vs admin)
- [ ] Consider compliance with state laws (notice requirements vary)

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All models created with migrations
- [ ] All API endpoints implemented and tested
- [ ] Frontend pages functional with real data
- [ ] Photo upload working (local storage for MVP, S3 later)
- [ ] Fine posting to ledger working correctly
- [ ] Email notifications sent on escalation
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Feature demonstrated in UI

## Success Metrics

**MVP Success Criteria:**
- 20+ violations created in pilot HOA
- 100% of fines posted correctly to owner ledgers
- 0 selective enforcement complaints
- Evidence photos preserved with timestamps
- Board reports "more consistent enforcement" in feedback

---

## Notes

**Mobile-First Consideration:**
- Inspector walks property with tablet/phone
- Responsive web app (not native mobile initially)
- GPS and camera access via browser APIs
- Offline support not required for MVP

**Legal Compliance:**
- Notice requirements vary by state
- California: 10 days to cure before fine
- Florida: 14 days for first offense
- Texas: Varies by CC&Rs
- System should support configurable notice periods

**Future Enhancements (Post-Sprint):**
- Bulk violation import (mass enforcement)
- Recurring violations (e.g., parking violations every week)
- Owner portal view (see violations and cure status)
- Integration with ARC (violations from unapproved changes)
